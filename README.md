#Hello! 
#I am a Bioinformatics Honours Student who has recently learnt to program in bash, python, R, STATA and will be learning more soon!
#I would say I am most confident in R programming
#I have a degree in Statistics, Genetics and Biochemistry, so most of my code is statistics related.
#My honours thesis consists of genomic data simulation, quality checking and variant calling, so stay tuned for that script!
